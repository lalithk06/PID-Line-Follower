# 🤖 ESP32 Line Follower Robot — Hardware Design
*A compact and efficient line follower robot built using the ESP32*

This project showcases the schematic and PCB design of a reliable line follower robot capable of high-speed tracking with stable power delivery and clean motor control. It is designed as a practical exploration of real-world embedded hardware development and PCB design workflows.

## ⚙️ Working Principle

- The **ESP32 DevKit (38-pin)** acts as the main controller.
- An **8-channel IR sensor array** detects the line:
  - **6 sensors operate in analog mode** for precise position tracking.
  - **2 sensors operate in digital mode** for edge detection.
- The **TB6612FNG motor driver** controls two DC motors with efficient PWM-based speed regulation.
- A **LM2596 buck converter** steps down the battery voltage to provide a stable **3.3V rail** for the ESP32 and logic circuitry.
- Two push buttons allow:
  - **Calibration mode** – tune sensor thresholds.
  - **Mode selection** – switch between operating behaviors.
- Decoupling capacitors and a ground plane ensure noise reduction and power stability.
